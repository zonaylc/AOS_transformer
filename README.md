# AOS_transformer

### Human Detection on AOS-Simulation Data UsingTransformer:
A challenge for creating a new solution for [Airborne Optical Sectioning](https://github.com/JKU-ICG/AOS) data. The task is to detect injured people in the forest with thermal images taken with a drone.

The implementation was done and shown in Google Colab due to the GPU issue. The fine-tuned transformer was trained using the scripts from the repository:[woctezuma
/detr](https://github.com/woctezuma/detr) forked from [facebookresearch/detr](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr).
